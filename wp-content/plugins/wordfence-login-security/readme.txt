#### TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION

* Two-factor authentication (2FA), one of the most secure forms of remote system authentication available.
* Use any TOTP-based authenticator app or service like Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password or FreeOTP.
* Enable 2FA for any WordPress user role.
* Completely free to use, no limits or restrictions of any kind.

#### LOGIN PAGE CAPTCHA

* Easily enable Google ReCAPTCHA v3 on your login and registration pages.
* Stops bots from logging in without inconveniencing your site visitors.
* Robust protection against password guessing and credential stuffing attacks distributed across large IP pools

#### XML-RPC PROTECTION

* XML-RPC is the biggest target for WordPress attacks, but is often overlooked.
* Protect XML-RPC with 2FA or disable it altogether if itâ€™s not needed.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the Wordfence Login Security through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Wordfence Login Security is now activated.

To install Wordfence Login Security on WordPress Multisite installations:
